3D t-shirt design app (and buy afterwards)
It is possible to design the texture of the shirt in any color the customer wants or even add an image that will determine the texture of the shirt
And the same goes for a logo that will be added to the shirt and everything in a three-dimensional model to make it easier for the customer
